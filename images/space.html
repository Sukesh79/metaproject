	The metaverse is a collection of 3D-simulated artificial environments designed to foster social interaction. It is sometimes defined as a speculative incarnation of the Internet as a unified, worldwide digital environment that is assisted by the usage of augmented reality and virtual headgear. The metaverse has recently gained lots of spotlight in technology circles, as it has eased the approach to several possibilities for almost everyone. Real-world scenarios that are often hard to achieve can be easily simulated in the metaverse through virtual and augmented reality. One of the most noticeable progressions in this context is virtual space tourism. In the real world, space tourism is a commercialized activity offered to consumers by state or independent enterprises for a trip to space for a number of objectives, including space research, leisure, and business. The notion of contemporary space tourism was initially proposed in early 1970 with the Space Shuttle, which was designed to take 74 guests into orbit as well as the essential development and experimental equipment for the initial Space Station. Now, with the advent of the metaverse, space tourism has become virtually accessible for anyone who has a computer and Internet access. A VR spacewalk, VR moon-base experience, and VR-based Mars mission are some of the key examples of virtual-reality-based space exposures.
	In parallel to the availability of VR-based tourism services, the acceptance and readiness among local tourists and travelers play a significant role in the success of this technology.
