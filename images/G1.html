   2 particular we seek a geometry, which maximizes the validity of cross-estimates among the entities, which are fitted into this geometry. It is a broad-brush display, more to come.<h3>  1.0 A Utility View of Geometry </h3> Motion, action, dynamics are defined over a space, a geometry. Physics was for centuries locked into Euclidean geometry, until Einstein explained the mystery of gravity through a non-Euclidean space. Quantum entanglement, the body-wave duality, and various singularity paradoxes may be reflective of our present geometry coming under terminal stress. Let us then revisit the very notion of the framework of physical science. A geometry may be likened to scaffoldings where objects are fitted and placed.ional space.

   In the end, we donâ€™t even need to have a single virtual world that is the same for all participants. What if the world itself was customizable? In the physical world, fixed objects exist in the same place for all parties, but this need not be the case in a computer program. </p>       </div>
