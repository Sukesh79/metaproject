This means that the object itself has three key values assigned to it in order to understand where it exists within the space.</p><p>

To better understand this concept, let’s picture that we are standing within a doorway looking into an empty and perfectly square room. Now, let’s place a ball somewhere in that room.

Since the room is not flat, but rather is a three-dimensional space, the ball has three important values that establish where it is located within the room: the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. 
Three-dimensional (3D) design continues to evolve since its earliest inception in the 1960s, which was led by Ivan Sutherland, creator of the world’s first 3D software called Sketchpad.</p><p>

With the evolution of 3D design, designers now have the ability to create CGI objects or worlds, while making them as realistic as they desire. In addition to improvements made to 3D graphics, computer software used to create these elements has become more efficient and easier to use.

As a result of the advances in 3D design, designers have been incorporating 3D objects into their design work more than ever before. This includes logo design, animation, web design, and even user interfaces, especially with the applications available through offerings like XR products.
