         <h4> Infinite Virtual Space Meta Protocol (IVS-MP)</h4>
<p>
    The representation of the IVS meta-protocol mainly includes a large number of visible virtual spaces published and certified by IVS, and the access protocols of the spaces. IVS-MP defines the format specification for reading, parsing and transmission that can be accessed in the IVS space, and is a core component for users to participate in the IVS space. IVS-MP will be deployed on multiple main networks, and asset layer interworking will be achieved through IVS bridges. Users can actively choose the space and main network that will host assets.
    Although not all Metaverse platforms require a dedicated virtual reality headset. Some of the metaverse platforms like Decentraland can be experienced by just using your desktop PC or laptop using your internet browser. But to best experience the platforms ultimately all Metaverse platforms might require a VR headset but right now its not mandatory.
</p>
  <p>Infinite Virtual Space (IVS) was established under the continuous development of Metaverse. IVS is to build an overall framework for integrating Metaverse, including protocols, front-end development engines, cross-chain mechanisms and economic models, and provide a complete infrastructure for Metaverse.</p>

    Remove dependence on hardware</h3>

      <p>Your laptop is an obvious choice, but a few other vital pieces of equipment might be easy to forget. Be sure to pack the following:

      Projector and replacement bulb<br>
      Mouse and mouse pad<br>
      Remote (the ones with the built-in laser pointer are nice)<br>
      Microphone<br>
      Headphones (if you use them)<br>
      Appropriate cables, including a dual mini plug if you use a boom box for sound (#9)<br>
      Video adapter (many projectors want VGA)<br> if your laptop doesn’t output VGA
      Most conference facilities will supply some or all of these items, but working with your own equipment has its advantages: You’ll be more at ease with your own equipment and you’ll be able to quickly troubleshoot most problems. Also consider the addition of a portable screen. A blank wall works in a pinch, but it isn’t the best way to present yourself, your product, or your company.<br>
      <br>
      We don't need all equipment while presenting in metaverse

    3d holograms</h3>
    <div style="background-color:#333333;color:#eeeeee;font-size:21;">

      <p>We can say that a hologram is the encoded version of a lightfield. Or that it is a special kind of photography that can encode completely how light scatters around an object, so that not only the intensity of light (like a classical photography), but all the properties of the light rays that come from that object are recorded into it.

      Let me make an imaginary example to explain this better. Imagine that you take a photo of something with a special holographic camera, for instance, a beautiful flower garden. Then you take this picture, that is 2D, and looking at it, it is like you always had a 2D window through the 3D garden wherever you are. It is a flat picture, but looking through it from whatever point of view you can really feel all the colors, the reflections, the depth cues, the parallax, of the garden you have taken the photo to. A permanent window to that garden. This is what a hologram can be.
      </p>After this explanation, I think you already got one of the reasons why holograms matter. Our VR headsets are a window towards a 3D world, too, but they have just simple stereoscopy and no possibility of focusing on objects at different depths. If we could have a holographic display inside them, we could see reality in a new way, with complete depth perception and focus, parallax, etc… That would be incredibly realistic.

    physical pleasures</h3>

      <p>They're able to do this using haptic technology. Essentially, it works with the use of a thin array of transducers that are integrated to the belly of the VR headset (an Oculus Quest 2) which directs ultrasound energy to different parts of the mouth.

      The study has been published in Future Interfaces Group. In an example, researchers reveal how it would essentially work. For instance, when playing a horror game in VR or metaverse, the tech could simulate the feeling of a spider brushing across the lips, or feel some liquid actually falling into the mouth.

      The tech is also able to simulate the motions experienced while brushing teeth, smoking, feeling rain, sipping a drink and even a kiss.
</p>
      <p>Researchers explain in their paper, “Proximity of the mouth to the headset offers a significant opportunity to enable on- and in-mouth haptic effects, without needing to run wires or wear an extra accessory. We developed a thin, compact, beamforming array of ultrasonic transducers, which can render haptic effects onto the mouth.”
        They added, “Importantly, all components are integrated into the headset, meaning the user does not need to wear an additional accessory or place any external infrastructure in their room.”

    It’ll be interesting to see what more levels of feeling we could soon get to experience in the metaverse and if it could ever come even remotely close to the real deal.
