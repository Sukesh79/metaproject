   <p> Believe it or not, the term metaverse originated back in 1992 courtesy of writer Neal Stephenson. In his novel “Snow Crash”, Stephenson explains the metaverse as a virtual place where people interact with digital avatars. 
      <br>

The novel basically combines “meta” and “universe” to arrive at the term “metaverse”. But the evolution of the meaning and scope of the metaverse didn’t stop in 1992.
 <br>
After that, virtual interactive worlds or early metaverses have been introduced primarily in video games with releases like Second Life, The Sims, and more recently with GTA V, Fortnite, and others. 
<br>
Another representation of the metaverse in pop culture is the central plot of the movie, “Ready Player One”. Currently, the metaverse is being turned into a reality by a handful of companies.

      Innovation abounds in the decentralized metaverse, where non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies are freely exchanged between participants, and users are given free reign over the building blocks to a frontier owned by no one and everyone all at once. Indeed, the decentralized metaverse gives individuals more ownership of these parallel spaces. But the metaverse is not an entirely new idea. While the term first appeared in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash, a book that would later influence the likes of Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg in their quest to build linkages between the virtual and physical worlds, the roots of the metaverse extend even farther back into the 20th century. Devices and concepts premised on virtual reality and a hazy vision of the future internet laid the groundwork for a World Wide Web that today plays host to parallel worlds where millions of people around the world socialize; create, buy and sell assets; work; and learn together. The metaverse has traditionally been the domain of private enterprises, like game developers and Internet companies, which built a patchwork of virtual worlds, like Fortnite, There and Facebook Horizon, that, while rich, lacked interconnectivity. Today, though, a new type of metaverse has begun to take shape to take on these corporate players.
