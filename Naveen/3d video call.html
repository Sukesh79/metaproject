     	<p> A 3D conversation system can facilitate 3D conversations in an augmented reality environment, allowing conversation participants to appear as if they are face-to-face. The 3D conversation system can accomplish this with a pipeline of data processing stages, which can include calibrate, capture, tag and filter, compress, decompress, reconstruct, render, and display stages,” the patent reads.
        As you can imagine, this 3D calling tech will allow you to connect with your loved one in a three-dimensional form instead of a 2D one.
        As you can think, this 3D calling technology enables you to communicate with a loved one in three dimensions rather than two. The patent lists a range of devices, including augmented reality glasses and augmented reality/virtual reality headsets, smartphones, and maybe a hologram, that could serve as the principal instruments for such a 3D communication system.
        Despite this, Meta would like to disrupt the communication sector with its latest technology, given the company’s declining daily active users in the market and other concerns surrounding Facebook. As a result, the corporation may rush the creation of such a sophisticated 3D discussion system in order to reclaim its position as the market’s top social company. </p>
