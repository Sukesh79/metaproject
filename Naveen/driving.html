   The first Metaverse car for ride-hailing
   Users can request a ride in a remote driving car using the Holograktor app, and the car will come to pick them up. The passengers can enjoy the personalized True AR™ content while riding in whatever way they wish while the qualified remote driver has full control of the vehicle.
   Seemingly pulling together every ‘what if…’ idea from a racing game’s fans wildest dreams, Infinite Drive aims to become the metaverse’s premier (and premium) racing experience. And with ideas by the truckload and a great gaming heritage behind it, we’re backing this one to be a winner.

   Being a creation of The Tiny Digital Factory, the leading developer and publisher behind REVV Racing and GT Manager, Infinite Drive is already streaking from the starting line. But the title aims to go further and faster than anything they’ve previously built.

   Fueled by Web3, Infinite Drive is set to not only deliver the great driving gameplay players demand, with the kind of real-world auto maker licences that only the pros can deliver, but will include unique skills such as ‘racing to earn’ – taking control of another person’s top-ranked NFT car, entering official races, competitions and then – if you’ve got the skills – sharing the winning’s with your ride’s owner.
