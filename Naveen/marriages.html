     	<p>Abhijeet and Sansrati became the first couple to get married on Metaverse on February 5, 2022. The wedding took place on Yug Metaverse, an Indian metaverse platform. The association was conceptualized, organized and executed by the media agency Wavemaker India for ITC Ltd.
     	A couple from Tamil Nadu on Sunday threw their first-of-its-kind in India wedding reception on the Metaverse, an online universe of interconnected 3D virtual worlds
     	What are Metaverse weddings? Metaverse weddings include a virtual venue designed by a virtual space designer. Couples can invite guests, who they could not accommodate in the real setting, to celebrate their nuptials on the cloud.
     	Like a ceremony within a video game, though, it is important to note that any weddings that occur solely in the metaverse are currently not legal. (Even virtual weddings by videoconference, which many states allowed during the height of the pandemic shutdowns, have since been outlawed in New York State and elsewhere.)
     	What is a virtual wedding? A virtual wedding is a wedding where the officiant, guests, and couple are joined together by a video call. Having your wedding ceremony virtual doesn't mean you can't have the extras like a venue, decor, flowers, live musician and more!</p>
