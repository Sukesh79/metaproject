   <p> Destination Window Shopping: Think about how it would feel if you had the ability to check out a destination before you travelled there. Imagine wandering down the streets of Rome, making plans and bookmarking the places you’d like to visit before the actual trip? It would be wonderful, wouldn’t it? The opportunities are endless – one could compare destinations before deciding where to visit, evaluate whether an attraction is worth visiting or have a look at the view before picking a hotel. This new immersive experience will be a great leap from the current modes of vacation planning that include reading blogs/magazines and watching YouTube videos. To make the experience even more immersive, an embedded AR technology can guide you through your virtual visit just like a tour guide would.
Historical Travel: I want to travel to the Colosseum from 1,000 years ago, but alas, I was born a millennium too late. Can the metaverse make this dream a reality though? How cool would that be?! The metaverse can be used to recreate landmarks and buildings in all their past glory –  a simulation of course, but effective, nonetheless. This will allow travelers to learn about history and experience how our ancestors lived.
Hotel and Cruise Walkthrough: Before I choose a hotel room, I would like to virtually walk through the entire property and decide whether it matches my tastes, rather than just reading about it through reviews and looking at airbrushed pictures uploaded by the property. I really want to see how the room looks, and which direction it would be facing before I finalize my stay.hub-and-spoke transit systems like subways and light rail.
