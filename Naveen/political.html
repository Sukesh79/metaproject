   <p>The metaverse is a virtual world just as real and dynamic as the one we exist in — yet housed entirely online. Although virtual events are nothing new — people have been attending webcasts and live-streamed sessions for years, even before the pandemic — the metaverse has the potential to take these experiences to the next level. As the president of a company that offers a virtual event platform, I’ve seen users driving demand for more interactive online experiences where they can fully and easily participate in sessions, network with peers, identify new leads and, most importantly, nurture human interaction.
      The spread of Covid-19 moved many 2020 and 2021 meetings online. Some events were great; they utilized technology to bring new experiences to people. But some virtual events fell short. I’ll admit it: Not all events are created equal. There is a certain magic inherent in in-person events that is challenging to replicate online.

The metaverse may prove to be the solution. Once fully realized, the metaverse could deliver a highly interactive experience where people can move freely and participate in two-way dialogues without needing to leave their homes. In fact, the metaverse’s ability to transcend location and even languages is one reason it’s so exciting.</p>
