   <p>Recent world events such as the global pandemic have caused a massive shift in how we work. Remote work and online communication have been increasingly normalized and Zoom and other video conferencing and collaboration tools have transformed corporate dynamics. This transformation has the potential to go even further. Mark Zuckerberg, Founder and CEO of Meta, promises that the Metaverse will be the biggest game changer, enabling new ways of working; the so-called “Virtual offices” will greatly change the relationships between employees and companies in the coming years.

   If it does succeed, the question of hybrid work will no longer be about the division of home and work, but about achieving a balance between the virtual world and the physical world.
   Imagine yourself in a virtual work meeting, wearing a headset that connects you to augmented reality and allows you to interact with other people, without having to leave your home? With their respective Metaverses, Microsoft and Meta have shown that this can be a reality. Mark Zuckerberg himself showed how there could be different uses for augmented reality interactions at work in this video:
   The corporate Metaverse also intends to improve the mental health of professionals who work remotely, in order to keep motivation and productivity high. According to a survey by Lenovo, 44% of professionals surveyed would be willing to work in the Metaverse, because they believe it can deliver performance benefits in the workplace.
   The use of the Metaverse could save time and money when working remotely. </p>
