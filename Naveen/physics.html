   <p> Theory of quantum physics in which an infinite number of ever-growing alternate realities are created by our choices. In any alternate reality any choice that is made creates universes where each choice is explored.
      That is, we can imagine, with our minds, any universe (thus, the metaverse). And we can ‘represent’ this universe using X’s and Y’s (0’s and 1's).This is only possible because there is a mandatory circular-linear relationship between mind and matter (abstract and concrete reality) (any X and Y). Meaning, pi is the correct (technical) ‘name’ for, what humans experience as, ‘mind.’ (Think: metaverse.) (Metamodernism, metareality, metaphor, meta cognition, metarealism.)
      Surprisingly, he is adamant that we will need what he terms “optimum physics-based modeling and simulation” not just for the enterprise metaverse, but for the type of consumer internet that Mark Zuckerberg and others are espousing.

     I can understand why physics modeling is important in creating digital twins, one of the key concepts of the enterprise metaverse according to Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. It’s critical that a 3D “digital twin” object, such as a digital car or a twin of a piece of medical equipment, mimics its real-world counterpart precisely. But what does it matter if, say, a 3D equivalent of Facebook doesn’t have precise physics? Indeed, the 3D avatars from Horizon Worlds.
