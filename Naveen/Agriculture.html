        The metaverse could be a powerful tool used to make that tracking available anytime and reinvented into intricate education on the indoor farming industry. Offering micro-learning information in real-time, augmented reality reduces training time and allows farmers to learn on the go.
        Indoor farmers are already utilizing AR (augmented reality) technologies to digitize and monitor plant biology, progression, and data. The metaverse could be a powerful tool used to make that tracking available anytime and reinvented into intricate education on the indoor farming industry. Offering micro-learning information in real-time, augmented reality reduces training time and allows farmers to learn on the go.

      Indoor farmers can be trained and taught from anywhere in the world in a more immersive, interactive, and clear way. Education can be adapted and customized by language, environment, and in many other ways.
      A world reinvented via a virtual lens is becoming a more enticing reality of our time. The virtual reality market is growing fast and clocked in at $4.8 billion in 2021 and is only going up from there with the market projected to reach $12 billion by 2024. The Metaverse, a network of 3D virtual worlds centered around social connection, holds serious potential to penetrate just about every industry that we know, and Indoor Agriculture is no exception.
