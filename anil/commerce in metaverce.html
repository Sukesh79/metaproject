   <p><b>With the metaverse, e-commerce businesses will be able to provide shoppers with a highly personalized digital experience. In the field of e-commerce, the metaverse will deliver a completely advanced virtual reality. In fact, online shoppers will be able to engage with the products of their choice in real-time using their own virtual avatar. If an e-commerce company uses the metaverse to build a digital shop, customers will be able to enter, explore, and check out the brand’s items. Virtual stores in the metaverse will become a massive hit in the e-commerce industry, contributing to market growth during the forecast period.

Here at Cappasity, we also believe that the metaverse will have an enormous impact on e-commerce. Back in 2018, Cappasity demonstrated its vision of the metaverse for e-commerce, having worked on a visionary video for 6 months with the Feel Good Video studio.
We’re going to become one of the companies that will help brands take their first steps towards presence in the metaverse.<p/>
<p><b> We are launching a solution that will allow businesses to create NFT-based loyalty programs. What makes Cappasity’s NFT a valuable digital asset is that it can contain not only photos and videos, but also text (e.g. a product or brand’s history), immersive content (3D/3D View visualization, AR holograms, virtual try-on), VIP perks and exclusive benefits — like personalized product discounts, invitations to events, and more. Brands can add new content to NFTs even after the customer gets the token, which allows them to use Cappasity NFTs as a new customer communication channel.
The metaverse is expected to transform every aspect of our lives, including the way we shop online. According to the Metaverse in E-commerce Market report, the predicted growth of the metaverse in the e-commerce market share, from 2021 to 2026, is more than $60 billion at a progressing CAGR of about 36%. The key factor driving the growth of the metaverse in the e-commerce market is the growing popularity of  VR technology.
