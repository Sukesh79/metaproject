          <p><b>Technology evolves, changes occur and we adapt to them. The concept of the Metaverse has done the same. The technology is fairly new but every business and service is trying to adapt to it whether it is Healthcare, Entertainment, Education, or any other segment.

          In the Metaverse, communication, media, and advertising will be much more fascinating, as every brand will want to assure its existence through public relations actions. Brands are developing their own versions of the Metaverse, and why not? It is the future of communication after all. They don’t want to fall behind in the competition. Fashion brands ranging from Nike, Vans, Adidas, and Under Armour to American Eagle, Gucci, Ralph Lauren, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Dolce & Gabbana, Burberry, and even Disney are already making millions of dollars in virtual apparel and accessory sales in MMOs and/or NFTs.

          The Metaverse might be an all new term for designers; something that they are newly becoming familiarized with. The Metaverse acts as a digital frontier for designers to create unique experiences through the virtual world of social connection. You might be wondering, well what does this mean for designers? Well, in simple terms; it means designers will be able to turn the industry on its head, providing an immersive experience for Metaverse users through technological advances.
