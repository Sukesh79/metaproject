      GAMING IN METAVERSE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   </h2>
   <p> <b>
      Most Metaverse games have a decentralized economic model where developers and publishers own and distribute in-game assets. Meanwhile, the idea of allowing avatars to explore the vast virtual space is exciting to players. 
   Not everyone can travel. That’s where the Metaverse comes into play. It allows people to virtually go places they cannot physically go to. Using the combined power of Metaverse, AR and VR, an enhanced virtual world is being developed that provides users with a first-person experience.
   One of the key factors in the design and implementation of the Metaverse is the gaming industry. Gaming companies are heavily spending on research and development to create new and innovative ways to bring games to the metaverse.
   Metaverse games are growing in popularity since they give gamers a more realistic and immersive gaming experience. Metaverse projects are important for a new generation of play-to-earn games. By playing the Metaverse NFT or Blockchain game, players can obtain different in-game collectables to trade with other participants or on external markets.
   In addition, the realistic content of Metaverse games provides an additional platform for companies to unlock marketing possibilities. Ads in the Metaverse are unobtrusive, appearing in natural locations such as game billboards or character clothing. This provides brands with excellent exposure and opportunities for product placement in gaming environments.
