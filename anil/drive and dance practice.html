	Real-time digital worlds like the Metaverse are still in the stage of being developed as theory, so part of the intrigue surrounding the topic is what could be possible. Driving and vehicle culture within this space is still being developed and it’s exciting to think of the possibilities.

	he creative economy is arguably the most crucial component of the metaverse. Without artists, designers, musicians, poets, DJs, dancers and gamers, virtual worlds would be bleak and bland as they stand. Up until now, artists, musicians and the creatives of the world may have seemed low in the economic scale of top earners.
	The metaverse provides a space to escape from the reality of a world overtaken by the global pandemic. A world where arts of all kinds, including dancing, have taken a direct hit. The places where dancers often gathered have been closed off lately: Nightclubs, festivals, pubs, and clubs have seen their spaces tarnished by the virus.

They are no longer considered areas of relaxation, communal spaces to be enjoyed with strangers. Rather they have been cut off, suspended, and given a bad reputation as places where the virus can spread more rapidly. Don’t fear, the metaverse is ready and waiting to be discovered by dancers
