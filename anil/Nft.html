          <p>The constant need to engage consumers online will certainly impact the buyer’s journey and CX in the metaverse customer experience. We’ve yet to see the full picture, but we’re already seeing rising trends within these digital platforms. Therefore, brands selling mint NFTs and partaking in metaverse experiences should start building their CX roadmap for the future. New digital support channels will emerge that leverages on the changing customer behaviors towards NFTs, as well as to ensure consumer privacy and security in public virtual spaces.
          In a span of several months, the integration of NFTs in the metaverse has been fueling its virtual economy. Owning NFTs allows buyers an extension of their identity, community, and social experiences. Users need a digital crypto wallet to purchase NFTs for gaming, fashion items for avatars, real estate, and even art. Purchases are then coursed through a blockchain network, which provides unique codes registered under them, therefore attaching distinctive identities and properties to users. On the other hand, users can also mint anything they create, such as artworks, online community, games, or digital fashion into NFTs they can monetize through selling or auctioning.
          In most metaverses, NFTs can be purchased and resold within the platforms. For those requiring a crypto wallet to participate, in-game NFTs can also be resold in other platforms, and then cashed out for cryptocurrency or fiat money.Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) first launched in 2015 and has since been an area of enterprise of many tech-savvy consumers. This collided with the development of the metaverse, which has come a long way since the first acknowledged virtual platform was launched in 2003. Now, anything from gaming platforms and retail brands are growing their virtual footprint.
